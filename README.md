# Health Check System

## Overview

The main goal of this project was monitoring services status on internet.

To support project's decisions I've created docs directory that compiles all process to conceipt my project.

`docs/1_demand.txt`: Its file compile all ideas to build up the system and I used it to base my requirements analysis.

`docs/2_requirements.md`: Here I syntetized the main requiriments found on initial demand. I splited in: functional requirements, non-functional requirements and design requirements.

`docs/3_application_container.dio`: That file is a fragment from C4 model (only container) and It helped me to see the project in a big picture.

`docs/4_ui_ux`: In this folder I've scratched up the desktop and mobile wireframe to guide my frontend development.

`docs/5_db_modeling.dio`: Here I've elaborated DB schema to build the application.

`server`: I chosed to use Node TS with Express Framework to build my solution, to persist data I going to use PostgreSQL.
